# Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to prepare visualizations using citibike data in NYC during the month of August to assist stakeholders take data-driven decisions to whether implement the project in the city of Des Moines.

This map shows the locations where most bicycle trips are originated. As shown in the image, it seems it seems like the inner city in Manhattan is where most of the trips are originated. This will be an important consideration for the city of Des Moines where more bicycles should be placed at highly dense locations.

This bar graph shows the total number of trips by hour. It seems like the most bicycle trips occur between 8 and 9am and 5 and 6 pm. This is another important consideration as most maintenance activities should occur during off-peak hours during early morning hours.

This table shows that in general subscribers and males have highest number of trips. It is important to know this information to determine an expectation for how it would be in Des Moines with different demographic groups.

<p align="left"> <img src="/Resources/Trips_Duration.png"> </p>

This chart shows the duration of trips by the hour. It seems that trips that start around 12AM have highest number of trips with duration of about 10 minutes. The data for 1 and 2 AM is not showing any useful information as there where not many or any trips during these periods. It is recommended for the decision makers to filter the data for other hours of the day to understand the relationship.

This chart is similar to the previous one, but it shows the data by gender. It seems that both males and females have similar patterns, however, for some reason the unknown gender has a different pattern. More investigation should be done to determine why this is the case.

<p align="left"> <img src="/Resources/Weekday_Trips.png"> </p>

This heatmap shows the number of trips per hour by weekday. It is observed that weekdays observe AM and PM peak hour (7-8AM and 5-7PM) during weekdays (Monday-Friday). However, the pattern is different during weekends where it spread throughout the day.

This heatmap is similar to the one above but it shows the data by gender. While darker colors are shown for males, the patterns are similar. 

## Summary:

The analysis shows that males have significantly more trips by bicycles than females. This is very important observation as it how it would relate with the difference in demographics in Des Moines. It also seems that early morning hours would be the best time to schedule maintenance for bicycles as it seems like bicycle usage is minimal during these periods.

Based on several observations of the data, our team recommends running additional visualizations to support our analysis. These additional visualizations are described below:

1) Origin-Destination maps to show if they are balanced or if the bicycles needed to be moved between stations for imbalance

2) Gather Weather data and determine relationship between bicycle usage and weather. This will be important to have better expectations in implementing the project in Des Moines.
